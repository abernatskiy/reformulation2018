EVS - EVolutionary Server:
An application for separating evaluation from evolution

===========================================================

See DESCRIPTION for comments on the program's architecture.

main.py is both the configuration file and the executable. 
To configure the server, see comments in main.py. To run 
the server on Linux or Mac, open a terminal, change working 
directory to where this file is (e.g., by doing 
"cd ~/evs-master") and type

$ python main.py

Notes:
 - on some Linux distros you might want to use the 
   "python2" command instead of "python";
 - the only way to stop the program in its current version 
   is to press Ctrl+C in the terminal;
 - the program (main.py) automatically creates two pipes 
   named individuals.pipe and evaluations.pipe in its 
   working directory. You can delete or keep those, it 
   won't affect the program's execution.
