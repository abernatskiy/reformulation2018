Global requirements:
- traceable ancestry (reruns acceptable if they are not long)

Runs:

I. Distribution of convergence curves for multiple morphologies: 64 morphologies for three segments, 1331 morphology for ten segments - have to come up with sampling
 * Make sure to check the optimal morphology
II. Gigantic convergence vs. parameters:
 * number of segments: 3, (5), 10
 * timescales ratio: 0.2, 0.5, 0.8
 * morphological part of the search: parallel hill climber, random search (for timescale ratio 0.2)
 * controller part of the search: me, clune, parallel hill climber
